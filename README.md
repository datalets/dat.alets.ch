# dat.alets.ch

Plain HTML web site, with a list of projects in a _"why", "when", "where", "what"_ [CSV file](docs/data/projects.csv) and [Data Package](docs/data/datapackage.json).

The projects are loaded with [Papa Parse](https://www.papaparse.com/) and rendered as a [GitGraph](https://github.com/nicoespeon/gitgraph.js/), intended for use as a portfolio and small geeky home page - styled using the lightweight and beautiful [Picnic template](https://picnicss.com/).
